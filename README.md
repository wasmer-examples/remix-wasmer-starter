This is a [Remix](https://remix.run/) project bootstrapped with `create-remix-app`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```


## Deploy on Wasmer Edge

The easiest way to deploy your Remix.run app is to use the [Wasmer Edge](https://wasmer.io/products/edge).
